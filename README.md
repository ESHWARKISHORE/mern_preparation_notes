- Redux store configured and connected to the app
- `UserAdding.jsx` implemented with controlled inputs and dispatch to Redux

## ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ 27 June 2025 Friday

### âœ… React + Redux Toolkit
- Created `userAPI.js` with `createAsyncThunk` to fetch users from JSONPlaceholder
- Added `userFromAPISlice.js` to handle API data with `extraReducers`
- Integrated API flow with `ReusableTable.jsx` to display fetched users dynamically
- Verified loading, fulfilled, rejected states handled correctly

### âœ… DSA Progress
- Solved DSA Problem #13: LeetCode 121 â€“ Find Maximum Profit from Stock
- Committed to `/DSA` folder with proper problem number and tested output

### âœ… Notes
- Documented the purpose of `createAsyncThunk` and `extraReducers` usage under `react-redux/Day1`
- Clarified difference between `reducers` vs `extraReducers` for async flows

More updates will follow daily as I continue through the 30-day MERN + DSA prep journey.
