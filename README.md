## ðŸ“… Day 0 â€“ 26 June 2025 Thursday

### âœ… Setup & Planning
- Folder structure created for DSA, React Redux, and common components
- GitHub repo initialized and committed

### âœ… React + Redux Toolkit
- userSlice created under `/features/user/` with `addUser` and `clearUser` reducers
- Redux store configured and connected to the app
- `UserAdding.jsx` implemented with controlled inputs and dispatch to Redux
- `DisplayingUser.jsx` built to display users using Redux `useSelector`
- `ReusableTable.jsx` created for dynamic column table rendering using `Object.keys()`

### âœ… DSA Progress

- Added 11 previously solved problems into the `/DSA` folder
- All committed to GitHub

## ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ 27 June 2025 Friday

### âœ… React + Redux Toolkit
- Created `userAPI.js` with `createAsyncThunk` to fetch users from JSONPlaceholder
- Added `userFromAPISlice.js` to handle API data with `extraReducers`
- Integrated API flow with `ReusableTable.jsx` to display fetched users dynamically
- Verified loading, fulfilled, rejected states handled correctly

### âœ… DSA Progress
- Solved DSA Problem #13: LeetCode 121 â€“ Find Maximum Profit from Stock
- Committed to `/DSA` folder with proper problem number and tested output

### âœ… Notes
- Documented the purpose of `createAsyncThunk` and `extraReducers` usage under `react-redux/Day1`
- Clarified difference between `reducers` vs `extraReducers` for async flows

## ðŸ“… Day 2 â€“ 28 June 2025 Saturday

### âœ… JavaScript Practice
- Added p16-flattenArray.js and p17-closure.js examples

### âœ… DSA Progress
- Solved DSA Problem #14: Merge Two Sorted Arrays (two approaches)
- Committed as p14-mergeTwoSortedArray-app1.js and p14-mergeTwoSortedArray-app2.js

### âœ… React + Redux Toolkit
- Added `deleteUser` and `clearUser` reducers in `userSlice`
- Integrated Delete button in `ReusableTable.jsx` with parent handler pattern
- Verified removing individual users and clearing all users works as expected

### âœ… Next.js Starter
- Basic App Router structure created under `/app/` with:
  - `page.jsx` (Home)
  - `about/page.jsx` (About)
  - `contact/page.jsx` (Contact)
- Verified local routing works and Link component tested

## ðŸ“… Day 3 â€“ 29 June 2025 Sunday

### âœ… DSA Progress
- Solved DSA Problem #15: Move Zeroes
- Added artificial server delay to test Next.js loading fallback

### âœ… Next.js Progress

- Implemented `blog/page.jsx` as Server Component with API fetch
- Added `error.js` for fallback error handling
- Added `loading.js` for fallback loading UI
- Verified error boundary and loading boundary working with artificial delay

More updates will follow daily as I continue through the 30-day MERN + DSA prep journey.
